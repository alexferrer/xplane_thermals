Step 1 [Sandy Barbour's Xplane Python plugin]
If you already have installed Sandy Barbour's Xplane Python plugin, skip to Step 2
If not, You can get the latest plugin from his website.  http://www.xpluginsdk.org/python_interface.htm

[this are his instructions] 
Make sure that you get the version that matches the version of Python that you have
installed, this is very important.  The files are at: http://www.xpluginsdk.org/python_interface_latest_downloads.htm

If your OS has python 2.6 installed then make sure you use a PythonInterface plugin that
has a 26 suffix.
e.g. PythonInterfaceXXX26.xpl, were XXX is Win, Lin or Mac depending on the OS that
you are using.
Extract the plugin and the INI file from the zip file.
Copy the PythonInterfaceXXX26.xpl and the PythonInterface.ini files to the plugins
folder.
e.g. copy to “D:\X-Plane 9.00\Resources\plugins”
This could be C:\ or any other drive letter depending where you have installed XPlane.
