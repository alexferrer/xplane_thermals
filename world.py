  Central file to store all globally used variables.
  
  It is ugly to have globals but we depend on Xplane for lots of them
  so I rather read them once and store them here for all to use.

   Thermal behaviour information
   There are many factors that affect thermal size and strength as they move
   up from the ground to the highest point.
   For now I will store those values here..

Control factors
Constants for fine tuning the value of the lift forces from the thermal model into the plane. 
lift_val from model * lift_factor = final force to apply to plane
I suspect that different CPU's  will need different values and since a larger plane would 
have larger wing area, the lift factor will be different too.
Adjust at your own peril.. :)
